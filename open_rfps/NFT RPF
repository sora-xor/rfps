**Overview**
Smart contract to mint NFT on SORA 

**Proposal goals**
To implement a smart contract for users to mint cryptographic assets on the SORA network

**Motivation**
Increase the scope of tokens to include non-fungible tokens for SORA ecosystem users. Increase Polkaswap functionality and bring native NFT to the SORA ecosystem

**Scope of work**
Objectives: Set up and implement a smart contract to mint and burn Non-fungible tokens on the SORA network as well as the implementation for frontend UI updates that include an interface to visualise NFT within a userâ€™s wallet 

Using EIP as a guideline (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) to develop the smart contract for non fungible tokens on the SORA network in accordance to SORA network standards for Gas and Complexity.

A unique hash value is to be calculated from the artwork (to form a Unique Resource Identifier) and assigned to the token holder, with the hash value stored on the blockchain. 

Development of  IPFS  to store token metadata off-chain, associated to URI which then calls up / reaches data under its hash value, such as the link to artwork and associated data to implement proof of ownership. 

Develop the creation (minting) and destruction (burning) of NFT in accordance to pre-existing token standards already implemented in the SORA network 

**Milestones** 
Project to begin 15 September 2021 and be ready for testing by 30th September and released to the public tentatively by 1st November 2021 or latest 1st December 2021

**Deliverables** 
1-A smart contract that mints, burns and lists NFT within the SORA network, 
2- IPFS to store token metadata off-chain. 
3- UI on Polkaswap that allows users to mint NFT, visualisation of user NFT within their wallet 
Current roadblocks: No SC developed as of yet 

**Project completion comprises of**
1) Smart contract for NFT minting including the implementation of a user interface to mint and list NFT 
2) Functional user interface for owned NFT visualisation 

**Submission method**
