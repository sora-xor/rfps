**Overview-Sora in space**
Proposal goals Advertising the Sora Network in space during two space missions, DOGE-1 and Geometric-1
**Motivation**
Bringing global attention to users, investors and business partners from around the world to the Sora Network as an InterPlanetary Economic System (IPES) in an unprecedented and unique way of advertising
The advertising project (https://www.xiprotocol.io/) will be utilizing SpaceX for launching its space-based LED displays on the DOGE-1 Mission to the Moon and on the Geometric-1 Mission to Earth orbit. This is being done with proven space hardware partners and SpaceX. Such displays are visible globally via in-space cameras, streamed to sponsored websites, YouTube, and other social media channels. Further expansion into displays on the ground for ongoing exposure to the screen on Earth as well is planned. Ads will not be visible to the naked eye from the ground as the project does not create light pollution in the night sky or detriment to ground based astronomy in compliance to the UNOOSA and U.S. House Law – the image is strictly internal to the satellite.
**Scope of work**
Minting of XOR tokens to finance the purchase of Xi, Kappa, Gamma, Beta and Rho tokens needed to acquire OLED screen area for advertising https://docs.xiprotocol.io/about/claiming-pixels
The individual utilities of the Greek tokens are as below:
+Beta is used to claim the x coordinate on the satellite display screen.
+Rho is used to claim the y coordinate on the satellite display screen.
+Gamma is used to claim the brightness of pixels on the satellite display screen.
+Kappa is used to claim the hue of pixels on the satellite display screen.
**Milestones**
Minting XOR and buying the Greek tokens until April 8 2022
Launch and operation of the DOGE-1 Mission to the Moon lunar satellite Q4 2022 (or sooner; the mission is delayed, it was originally scheduled for March 2022)
Launch and operation of the Geometric-1 Mission to Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO) on October 1 2022
**Deliverables**
The Sora Network ad displayed on October 1, 2022 for 1 week, and also at a separate time in Lunar Orbit for 1 week on the Xi Protocol's space display 1200*1080 OLED screens, in cubesats which will orbit Earth and the Moon.

**Current roadblocks**
Minting is necessary in less than a week's time from RFP publication, there is no precedent for such campaigns.
Project completion comprises of
+Minting XOR
+Purchasing the Greek tokens
+Purchasing a one-month ad area of minimum 60x60 pixels size
**Submission Requirements**
Community referendum to mint the required amount of XOR for token purchase.
Submission Method (which folder on GitHub to submit a proposal to https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps
