## Overview
Currently we have these problems with democracy pallet
- Normal proposals are executing in 1 to 2.5 months if they go without fasttrack
- Some tokens are locked at proposals queue due to long launch time period
- We are forced to fasttrack proposals and this creates queues at system since council and techcommitte cant pass proposals fast enough and this causes delays for RFPs and payments.
- Normally, important proposals like minting, runtime update proposals needs SuperMajorityApprove but since we fasttrack those, it becomes SimpleMajority
- Since we need techcommitte to fasttrack proposals, current democracy system comes across as centralized

## Proposal goals
- Allowing community members to submit proposals faster
- Lowering the delay for RFPs and payments
- Making current democracy system more decentralized by not needing fasttrack from techcommitte
- Making proposals fairer by keeping their vote threshold(SuperMajorityApprove/SimpleMajority) as the default

## Scope of work
1. Determining suitable numbers for settings
  I would like to offer these settings: (if i miss a setting, let me know)
  - Launch time period: 3 days
  - Voting period: 6 days
  - Execution time: 1 days
2. Making remark proposal for community to approve
3. Changing these settings on the democracy pallet
  - Lowering launch period times
  - Lowering vote and execution time of proposals

## Current roadblocks and barriers to success
- Needing runtime update for these changes

## Submission requirements
Democracy pallet updated

## Submission Method
