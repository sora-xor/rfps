**Overview**
Smart contract to mint NFT on SORA \

**Proposal goals**
To implement a smart contract for users to mint cryptographic assets on the SORA network\

**Motivation**
Increase the scope of tokens to include non-fungible tokens for SORA ecosystem users. Increase Polkaswap functionality and bring native NFT to the SORA ecosystem\

**Scope of work**

Objectives: Set up and implement a smart contract to mint and burn Non-fungible tokens on the SORA network as well as the implementation for frontend UI updates that include an interface to visualise NFT within a users wallet \
\
Using EIP as a guideline (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) to develop the smart contract for non fungible tokens on the SORA network in accordance to SORA network standards for Gas and Complexity.\
\
A unique hash value is to be calculated from the artwork (to form a Unique Resource Identifier) and assigned to the token holder, with the hash value stored on the blockchain. \
\
Development of  IPFS  to store token metadata off-chain, associated to URI which then calls up / reaches data under its hash value, such as the link to artwork and associated data to implement proof of ownership.
\
Develop the creation (minting) and destruction (burning) of NFT in accordance to pre-existing token standards already implemented in the SORA network \
\

**Milestones** 
Project to begin 15 September 2021 and be ready for testing by 30th September and released to the public tentatively by 1st November 2021 or latest 1st December 2021\

**Deliverables** 
1-A smart contract that mints, burns and lists NFT within the SORA network, \
2- IPFS to store token metadata off-chain. \
3- UI on Polkaswap that allows users to mint NFT, visualisation of user NFT within their wallet \

**Current roadblocks** 
No SC developed as of yet \

**Project completion comprises of**
1- Smart contract for NFT minting including the implementation of a user interface to mint and list NFT \
2- Functional user interface for owned NFT visualisation \
\
**Submission method**
Front end update\
