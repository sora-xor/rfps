PROPOSAL DUE DATE:04/01/2024

VISION OF THE PROPOSAL

MY PROPOSAL IS ABOUT ADDING FUTURE MARKETS TO POLKASWAP, WHERE THERE WOULD BE FEES FOR OPENING AND CLOSING POSITIONS, AND THESE WOULD BE CONVERTED, ONE PERCENTAGE FOR BURNING XOR, AND ONE FOR PLATFORM LIQUIDITY, AS WELL AS THE SETTLEMENTS WOULD RETURN TO POLKASWAP LIQUIDITY, AND A PERCENTAGE OF XOR BURN

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSAL: TO INCLUDE FUTURES MARKETS IN POLKASWAP, AIMING TO INCREASE UTILITY, LIQUIDITY AND DECTRALIZATION IN THE PROJECT, IN ADDITION TO GROWING UTILITY IN THE DEFI SECTOR.

SCOPE OF WORK

1-CREATE THE TAB WITHIN POLKASWAP FOR FUTURES
2-ADD TO THE ORDERBOOK (READY), THE APPROPRIATE FUNCTIONS FOR LEVERAGE
3-ADD LEVERAGE LIMITS, GRADUALLY SO AS NOT TO HARMFUL THE LIQUIDITY OF THE PROJECT
4-ADD A MINI TUTORIAL FOR BEGINNERS, WITH CAUTION ALERTS.

CURRENT OBSTACLES

THE OPERATION OF THE ORDERBOOK MUST BE PERFECT, AS WELL AS THE SPEED OF THE NETWORK (WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM), DEFINE LEVERAGE LIMITS AT THE BEGINNING, SO THAT WE DO NOT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH LACK OF LIQUIDITY.

EVALUATION METRICS AND CRITERIA

WHEN EVERYTHING IS READY, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THE FUTURES MARKET WITHIN A PLATFORM AND A SECURE NETWORK SUCH AS SORA, AND POLKASWAP, A GROWING PRACTICE AND WITH A LOT OF DEMAND WITHIN THE DEFI SECTOR, WE DON'T SEE DEX WITH GOOD DEVELOPMENT LIKE POLKASWAP, TO HOST SOMETHING LIKE THIS, THE ADVANTAGES WILL BE MAINLY AROUND THE USE OF THE PLATFORM, AS THERE WILL BE MORE DEMAND IN DEMAND, AN INCREASE IN XOR BURNERS, AND IN LIQUIDITY, AS THE MONEY FROM SETTLEMENTS WOULD BE FOR THE PROJECT, SMALL ADJUSTMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED IN DESIGN, HOW TO ADD A FUTURES TAB.

REQUIREMENTS AND SUBMISSION:

I BELIEVE THAT THE PROJECT HAS ALL THE MEANS FOR THIS
