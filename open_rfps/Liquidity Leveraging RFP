**Proposal Due Date**

**Proposal Overview**
As a tool to increase trade volume, Liquidity leveraging will allow for larger amounts of liquidity to be traded by users. 
With liquidity leveraging, 80% of the XOR portion of a user's pool can be minted to leverage additional liquidity.
**Proposal Goals (list with explanations where possible)**
To allow for larger volumes of liquidity within Polkaswap, the implememtation of Leveraring by minting XOR should be added. 
Up to 80% of the XOR in a pool a user has can be minted and loaned to provide additional liquidity. 
Generated liquidity cannot be withdrawn by user leveraging until borrowed XOR has been paid back
There is no interest generated on borrowed XOR for Liquidity leveraging
**Scope of Work (describe the scope of work in as much detail as possible)**
+Implement aforementioned Liquidity Leveraging logic within Polkaswap liquidity source pallet, including collateral security and XOR minting
+Implement UI changes within Polkaswap to accomodate for this function, ideally within collapsable "Advanced Pooling" functions, with an attached disclaimer outlining the risks of leveraging liquidity
+Draft disclaimer outlining risks 
**Current Roadblocks and Barriers to Success**
+Functionality not available in current Polkaswap iteration
+UI requires an update to accomodate new functionality described
**Evaluation Metrics and Criteria (definition of done should be as clear as possible)**
Advanced pooling and Liquidity Leveraging implemented within Polkaswap UI
Underlying technology merged within SORA repositories
**Submission Requirements**
Fulfill evaluation metrics and criteria.
Pull requests to paths as outlined within Submission Method done before Due Date.
