**Proposal due date** - 12th of August 2022

**Proposal overview** - Public Request for tenders by teams to develop and implement a XOR coin toss game on the SORA network with 50/50 odds of winning/losing

**Proposal goals** -  The proposed XOR Coin flip will bring a fun dapp to the SORA network (think Dinosaur game easter egg on Google Chrome) where community members can try their luck in a transparent and decentralised method, where the player has no disadvantaged odds to the house.
If implemented, the game will bring more demand and utility to the XOR token and more transactions to the sora network, as well as an idle way for users to pass time.

**Scope of work** - Design and implement the game logic, graphic aspects (XOR coin design, etc), as well as the underlying code to allow XOR to be spent with every play and won in case of a successful guess, SORA network integration (Polkaswap)

**Current roadblocks and barriers to success** -  
Finding a qualified developer; Substrate has all the required functions to build the dapp including the verifiable random function (VRF), ensure that this dApp does not give the SORA network a negative connotation due to gambling, draft documentation and disclaimers on the website that reflect this, as well as implementing a shield against under-age use and use wherever such games are illegal

**Evaluation metrics and criteria** - 
The dapp requirements are as follows:

1- Build a dapp that executes a 50/50 win/lose scenario, with a randomised outcome that pays out 2x the buy-in cost if the outcome is a win. The player received no payout if the outcome is a loss.

2- Liquidity for the game to be provided by SORA governance through minting XOR
With 50/50 odds the cost to SORA governance would be net zero

3- Game costs should be a fixed price to reduce the possibility of large outliers and irresponsible players.
The goal is to have at least 1,000 additional transactions on the SORA network per day in the first 3 months, increasing to at least 10,000 transactions per day after 12 months.

**Submission requirements** - Looking for a developer or team with Substrate experience, and one UI/UX designer.

**Submission method** - Final code to be submitted to https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps/tree/master/open_rfps
