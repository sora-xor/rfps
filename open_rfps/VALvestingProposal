VAL Vesting RFP
**Proposal Due Date**
17th November 2021
**Proposal Overview**
Vested VAL for XOR ERC-20 holders in accordance to SORA v2 implementation and SORA v2 Tokenomics Referendum

**Proposal Goals (list with explanations where possible)**
Implementation of the tokenomics as per the SORA v2 Tokenomics referendum (https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-new-economic-order-tokenomics-referendum-31581e8b649) and the VAL deflationary tokenomics (https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-validator-reward-token-val-c96a8afb8541)

**Scope of Work (describe the scope of work in as much detail as possible)**
Implementations to include: 
+VAL vested per day to each XOR, as a remainder portion of the VAL that are burned everyday (burned amount -10% -daily validator reward %). 
+Burn VAL with every transaction on the SORA network

**Current Roadblocks and Barriers to Success**
+VAL tokenomics require a shift to adapt to the proposed implementations.

**Evaluation Metrics and Criteria (definition of done should be as clear as possible)**
Once this proposal is completed the following will be implemented:
+Constant reduction of VAL total supply 
+VAL will only be available through the initial airdrop, staking or nominating.
+Half of XOR used in SORA network transaction fees will be used to buy back and burn VAL tokens
+New VAL tokens will be minted to reward validators and nominators for the SORA network; rewards start at 90% of VAL burned within a 24-hour period and decreases daily, down to a flatline of 35% after 5 years.
+10% of the amount of VAL tokens burned within a 24-hour period will be minted every day and given to the SORA Parliament
