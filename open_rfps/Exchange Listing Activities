Proposal due date: 19th of April 2022
Proposal overview: This proposal regards the minting of XOR for activities pertaining to listings on Exchanges.
Proposal goals: The goal is to list XOR PSWAP VAL and XSTUSD with a SORA network integration on a prime centralized exchange and support all subsequent activities, such as, marketing, etc.

As the intended exchange is among the top 10  highest daily spot trading volume (at time of writing this proposal), it will be a good entry point for consideration of other major exchanges such as Binance or Kraken, as well as improving the current volume and growth rate of XOR, PSWAP, VAL and XSTUSD.

Scope of work: 
- Proposal approval to mint XOR as a loan (!)  to cover the necessary costs associated to listing in a centralized exchange
- payment and execution of all listing related activities - due to contract clauses and NDA’s we can’t disclose the details of the pending agreements.

Current roadblocks and barriers to success:
Timeline of full payback is unclear, we aim at 6-9 months. there will be some selling pressure for XOR in the pre-listing phase (up to 1 month).
We can’t disclose the details of our pending agreements

Evaluation metrics and criteria: 
Listing on centralized exchange with +$2B daily volume
increased volume for all SORA tokens
integration of SORA network
More holders of our ecosystem tokens

Submission requirements: 
Collaboration by Soramitsu to integrate SORA network 
Add budget to actual proposal
