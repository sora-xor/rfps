Proposal due date: 30th of April 2022
Proposal overview: This proposal regards the minting of XOR for activities pertaining to listings on Exchanges.
Proposal goals: The goal is to list XOR PSWAP VAL and XSTUSD with a SORA network integration on a prime centralized exchange and support all subsequent activities, such as, marketing, etc.

As the intended exchange is among the top 10  highest daily spot trading volume (at time of writing this proposal), it will be a good entry point for consideration of other major exchanges such as Binance or Kraken, as well as improving the current volume and growth rate of XOR, PSWAP, VAL and XSTUSD.


Scope of work: 
- Proposal approval to mint XOR as a loan (!)  to cover the necessary costs associated to listing in a centralized exchange
- payment and execution of all listing related activities - due to contract clauses and NDA’s we can’t disclose the details of the pending agreements.

Current roadblocks and barriers to success:
Timeline of full payback is unclear at the moment, we aim at 6-9 months. There will be some selling pressure for XOR in the pre-listing phase (up to 1 month).
We can’t disclose the details of our pending agreements.

Evaluation metrics and criteria: 
Listing on centralized exchange with +$2B daily volume
increased volume for all SORA tokens
integration of SORA network
More holders of SORA ecosystem tokens

Submission requirements: 
Collaboration by Polka Biome to integrate SORA network 

Submission method: https://github.com/sora-xor/rfps/tree/master/open_rfps

Budget amount: 

Mint $712k in XOR to get:
$146k XOR
$375k USDT
$85k ETH
$56k VAL
$50k XSTUSD
(PSWAP will be provided by Polkaswap Community members, no mint required)
Reminder: this is a loan and will be paid back and burned.
